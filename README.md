# Backstory
An evil copy of the wordle game.

Whoops! Seems like the author copied it twice!

And now the cloned wordle has envolved into an evil creature!

# How to play
Download the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then run the code!

(sorry for not using virtual envs, those are too complex.)

# Issues
~~I've tried my best shrinking the WORD_LIST_COMPRESSED file, it seems like I've failed/used the wrong way to,
the size is currently 1.08MB on my computer, if someone can further shrink that, please PR or issue, to tell me how!
Thanks!~~
Resolved, it seems like I forgot to filter the dictionary to 5 words only.
